# diceware-passphrases
A short script that I designed in Python 3.4 to generate secure and totally random passphrases based on Diceware™.

Diceware™ is a method for picking passphrases that uses dice to select words at random from a special list called the Diceware Word List. Each word in the list is preceded by a five digit number. All the digits are between one and six, allowing you to use the outcomes of five dice rolls to select a word from the list.

The Diceware method of generating passwords is very secure and completely transparent.

The complete list contains 7776 short words, abbreviations and easy-to-remember character strings. The average length of each word is about 4.2 characters. The biggest words are six characters long. The English list is based on a longer word list posted to the Internet news group sci.crypt by Peter Kwangjun Suk.
